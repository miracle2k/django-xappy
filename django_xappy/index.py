        This method detects this situation (a non-existant page being

        **(results, fixed_page_num)**.

        All other **kwargs will be passed on the Xappy's ``search``
        method. For example, you may use it to enable the ``getfacets``
        option.

        a result page actually containing less items than advertised.
